# STRAUSS Workflow

We will document our activities in Workflow documents. These documents are in Markdown format and are stored in the repositories containing the relevant code and scripts.

Ambition: Be as concise as possible, but not too concise. The main objective of the Worklogs is to make work done reproducible (by peers).

This is the main Workflow document for the STRAUSS project. If relevant, separate workflow documents can be made for the regions (to be decided).

- Added some documentation

````bash
# this is an example of code executed 
echo 'Example ...'
````

````python
# Example of interactive command line code executed in Python
print("Example")
```` 
- (Hasselt): Added a ipyton workbook to cluster buildings from OSM.
- make sure to never commit data to Gitlab: added `.gitignore` file.
